Sunday mornings were the best because they meant only one thing: The Giant Sunday Newspaper Puzzle Section! Piper, who was seven and knew how to solve a cryptic crossword before breakfast, grabbed the paper the moment it landed on the porch.

Today, the last puzzle was a special competition called "The Secret Sound." The clue was a cryptic riddle: I wear a helmet of gold, but have no fear of war. My laughter echoes deep inside the forest door.

Piper worked quickly, matching the rhyming clues to letters, circling words about forests and echoing calls. When all the letters were lined up just right, the solution didn't spell a word. It was a website address!

Piper typed the address into the tablet. Click! And there it was: a picture of the most amazing, unfamiliar bird Piper had ever seen. It had bright orange feathers, dark wings, and a giant, sunny beak that looked like a curved yellow banana.

“What are you?” Piper whispered. The bird looked majestic, but its name was nowhere to be found. Piper tried every search word they could think of: Banana Beak Bird, Helmet Bird, Orange Forest Flier. Nothing matched the official database!

Suddenly, Piper knew where the real answers lived. Not on a website, but surrounded by wood, paper, and the delicious, comforting smell of old stories. The next morning, Piper marched straight to the school library.

Ms. Shelly, the librarian, smiled warmly. "What magnificent discovery are we hunting today, Piper?" Piper carefully showed her the picture. "It's a mystery bird, Ms. Shelly! I need a book that knows everything about birds with giant sunshine beaks!"

Ms. Shelly led Piper deep into the Non-Fiction section, past shelves dedicated to Dinosaurs and Deep Sea Fish. "The secret to knowledge," she whispered, "is the Dewey Decimal System. We need the 598s—the Birds!"

And there, tucked between a book on puffins and one on penguins, was a large, brightly illustrated book called Great Birds of the Rainforest. Piper opened it excitedly, flipping past toucans and parrots, until... BINGO!

The illustration matched exactly! "A Hornbill!" Piper cheered silently. The magnificent creature from the puzzle was real. Piper realized that every puzzle, big or small, just needed the right book to unlock its secret.

By Mallika Gaur
Page 1/10
Fuddle the squirrel lived in the tall oak, surrounded by wonderful things. He built tiny levers and gears that could whir and click, fixing all sorts of problems. But Fuddle kept his inventions locked tight inside his chest, afraid to show the world how brilliant he really was.

Outside, life was always moving, moving, moving. Sometimes it felt like a smooth, sunny wave—up and down, predictable and steady. Fuddle watched from his window as his neighbors went through their daily routines.

Fuddle saw the struggle. He had just the thing: a small, perfect pulley system, designed yesterday, that could lift three times its own weight! This was the chance to stop watching and start helping.

Go now! a voice whispered inside him. It’s simple! Just show Mason! Fuddle scurried down the tree trunk, clutching the pulley, his heart beating like a tiny drum.

But then the familiar confusion began to cloud his mind. What if it breaks? What if Mason already has a better idea? What if I look silly carrying this tiny thing? The feelings swirled, pausing his paws right before they hit the ground.

He hesitated for one long, silent moment. That was the moment—the chance to get over his own fears and step forward clearly. He had so many chances like this, living a life that went up and down, but never truly changed direction.

Just as Fuddle finally shook off the swirling thoughts and stepped into the clearing, he heard a triumphant shout. “Got it!”

Fuddle watched as the bridge log settled perfectly. Another neighbor, an Otter named Rill, who had simply applied strong teamwork, clapped Mason on the back. Fuddle realized, with a sad sigh, that the unique, precious moment to offer his specific help was already gone.

He tucked the perfect pulley back inside his coat. I didn’t just miss the chance to help Mason, Fuddle thought, I missed the chance to stop the confusion. He walked back to his oak, knowing that next time, the only way to flatten the sine wave of his life was to leap off it, fast.
